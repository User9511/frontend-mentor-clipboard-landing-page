## My process

I opened the design in Adobe Photoshop and broke it into several different sections using yellow & blue rectangles. I looked at each section and then decided to use either CSS Grid / Flexbox to achieve the desired layout.

I began working from the top down. Once I completed a section on desktop I would then ensure that it was also working on mobile using a media query.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1.  I had issue with changing the colour of the social media icons (.SVG's) on :hover

The solution was to specify 'svg path'

```
.svg path:hover {
  fill: var(--Strong-Cyan);
}
```

2.  I had issues getting this design to scale on tablet sized devices.

My solution was to add a media query for tablets:

```
@media only screen and (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 820px) {

}
```

3.  I wasn't sure if my HTML was completely semantically correct.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for laying out all of page elements. I really liked this guide and will use it going forward.
